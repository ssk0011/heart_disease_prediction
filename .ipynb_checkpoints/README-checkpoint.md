Fine tuning a machine learning model based on a binary classification Kaggle dataset for heart disease.

Using the dataset, this notebook tests multiple machine learning models intended to handle smaller datasets, in order to determine which one best fits to the training data.

A second feature of the notebook is feature importance based on the logistic regression model utilized in the larger grid search implementation.

## Observations

Of the three models tested, logistic regression performed the best. The other two models, nearest neighbors and decision tree, achieved 100% accuracy on the test data, heavily implying the models were overfitted after grid search. Logistic regression, meanwhile, attained a highly respectable 86%.

## Future work

Check if there are additional records to add to this dataset to further train the model on.
